## Acceptance Criteria
-   When I open the Note Taker, then I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.

-   When I click on the link to the notes page, then I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.

-   When I enter a new note title and the note’s text, then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.

-   When I click on the Save icon, then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.

-   When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, then that note appears in the right-hand column.

-   When I click on the write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
